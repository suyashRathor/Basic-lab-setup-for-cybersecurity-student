Lab Scenarios and Exercises
Scenario 1: Basic Network Scanning and Enumeration

    Objective: Use Nmap and Wireshark to scan the network and enumerate available services.
    Steps:
        Perform a network scan using Nmap on the internal network.
        Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
        Document the identified devices and services.

Scenario 2: Vulnerability Assessment

    Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in the Metasploitable 2 VM using OpenVAS.
    Steps:
        Set up OpenVAS on the Ubuntu VM.
        Scan the Metasploitable 2 VM for vulnerabilities.
        Analyze the results and document the findings.

Scenario 3: Exploitation and Post-Exploitation

    Objective: Exploit a vulnerability in Metasploitable 2 and perform post-exploitation tasks.
    Steps:
        Use Metasploit on Kali Linux to exploit a vulnerability in Metasploitable 2.
        Gain access and perform post-exploitation tasks (e.g., privilege escalation).
        Document the exploitation process and the results.

Scenario 4: Incident Response

    Objective: Simulate a cyber attack and perform incident response.
    Steps:
        Simulate an attack on the Windows 10 VM.
        Detect and analyze the attack using security tools.
        Document the incident response steps and remediation actions.

Documentation and Logs

All steps, configurations, and outcomes are documented to provide a detailed reference for each scenario. Logs are regularly reviewed to understand the actions taken and their outcomes.

Future Enhancements

    Expand the lab: Add more VMs with different operating systems and configurations.
    Advanced Scenarios: Develop more complex scenarios involving multiple VMs and advanced attack techniques.
    Continuous Learning: Keep the lab updated with the latest tools and techniques.

Conclusion

This virtual lab setup provides a robust environment for learning and practicing cybersecurity skills. By simulating real-world scenarios, it prepares you for challenges in the field and helps in gaining practical experience necessary for professional growth.
